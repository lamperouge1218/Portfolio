# Phil Bohn Professional Portfolio

## Description

This page was designed as an exercise in showcasing fundamentals of CSS and Flexbox. This project was built, not only as a showcase of these things, but also as a repository for links about future projects that I may do. It is going to evolve and change over time as I experience more of the UPenn BootCamp. I learned how to style a page both aesthetically and functionally.

## Usage

In this section, there are, available for perusal, both a link to the deployed site as well as a screenshot. Each image on the deployed site is a clikable link (though only one currently goes to an actually functioning site).
