# Phil Bohn Professional Portfolio

## Description

This page was designed as an exercise in showcasing fundamentals of CSS and Flexbox. This project was built, not only as a showcase of these things, but also as a repository for links about future projects that I may do. It is going to evolve and change over time as I experience more of the UPenn BootCamp. I learned how to style a page both aesthetically and functionally.

## Usage

In this section, there are, available for perusal, both a link to the deployed site as well as a screenshot. Each image on the deployed site is a clikable link (though only one currently goes to an actually functioning site). The Nav links in the Header will also auto scroll to the associated location on the page.

## Credits

For this project, I extensively used the sites [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), as their repositories of coding information, explanation, and implementation proved invaluable. 

I also used the tutorials on Flexbox from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) as his explanations were quite useful for understanding Flexbox and its uses.
